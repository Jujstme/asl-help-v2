# asl-help Legacy Branch

Welcome to the **legacy** branch of the `asl-help` library. It hosts the binaries for `asl-help`'s
previous iterations.

The source code for the legacy `asl-help` library can also be found here. Please note that the `src/Emu`
and `src/Unreal` projects are **not** part of the legacy `asl-help` library, but merely work-in-progress
bits of code.

## Using asl-help

If you would like to start using `asl-help` in your autosplitters, please head on over to the
[**main** branch](https://github.com/just-ero/asl-help) and continue there.
